Services like [Xively](https://xively.com/), [ThingSpeak](https://www.thingspeak.com/) and [Nimbits](http://www.nimbits.com/) all provide excellent features but they require enough prerequisite knowledge of certain web technologies that may come across as intimidating, especially to those who may be new to programing. While searching for a simpler method to teach to youth, I came across some wonderful examples on [journal.code4lib.org](http://journal.code4lib.org/articles/8200) and [Instructables](http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-use-Google-docs-for-data-logging/) on how to utilize Google Docs as an easier solution.\r\n\r\nI designed this tutorial to give a brief overview of multiple software and hardware components. With that said, this process can be made even simpler with devices such as an [Arduino Wifi Shield] (http: //Arduino. cc/en/Main/ArduinoWiFiShield), [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org/) or an [Electric Imp](http://electricimp.com/), just to name a few.\r\n\r\n**Hardware used in this tutorial:**  \r\n* [Temperature and Humidity Sensor (Grove)](http://www.seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove-_Temperature_and_Humidity_Sensor)  \r\n* [Moisture Sensor (Grove)](http://seeedstudio.com/wiki/Grove_-_Moisture_Sensor)  \r\n* [Arduino Uno](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/arduinoBoardUno)  \r\n* [Breadboard](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-use-a-breadboard)\r\n\r\n**Software used in this tutorial:**  \r\n* [Arduino](http://arduino.cc/en/main/software)  \r\n* [Humidity Temperature Sensor](https://github.com/Seeed-Studio/Grove_Temperature_And_Humidity_Sensor) - Arduino Library [(How to install)](http://arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries)  \r\n* [Processing](http://processing.org/)  \r\n* [HTTProcessing](https://github.com/runemadsen/HTTProcessing) - Processing Library [(How to Install)](http://wiki.processing.org/w/How_to_Install_a_Contributed_Library)  \r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n###1. Arduino\r\n+ Setup your sensors by assembling the breadboard as shown below. In this setup we are only using the breadboard to send power and ground across the side rails. Connect the signal of your humidity & temperature sensor to the Arduino's **Digital Input Pin 2** and the signal of your moisture sensor to the Arduino's **Analog Input Pin 0**  \r\n \r\n![breadboard](https://raw.github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/gh-pages/images/breadboard.jpg)\r\n\r\n+ Open and run [PlantSensors.ino](https://github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/blob/gh-pages/*Arduino/PlantSensors/PlantSensors.ino). Now open your Serial Window and you 3 variables streaming.\r\n\r\n![serialview](https://github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/blob/gh-pages/images/serialviewsmall.jpg?raw=true)\r\n\r\nSensor | Range \r\n------ | ------ \r\nHumidity | 20% - 90% ([RH](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relative_humidity))\r\nTemperature | 0 - 50 (C) \r\nMoisture | 0 - 950  \r\n\r\n\r\n###2. Google Forms\r\n+ Create a Google Form with 3 text inputs labeled:  \r\nHumidity, Temperature and Moisture\r\n\r\n![googleform](https://raw.github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/gh-pages/images/googleform.jpg)   \r\n\r\n+ While Viewing the Form, copy the url key located here and save it for later, we will need it:  \r\n\r\n![googleform](https://raw.github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/gh-pages/images/formkey.jpg)   \r\n\r\n+ Next, save the entry id that is generated for each field by control clicking on the field and selecting Inspect Element (note: this method may vary depending on your browser).  Here you can find the entry ID as the string of numbers following **#entry_** .  \r\n\r\n![entryid](https://raw.github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/gh-pages/images/entryid.jpg)   \r\n\r\n\r\n###3. Processing\r\n+ Open and run [SensorsTest.pde](https://github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/blob/gh-pages/*Processing/SensorsTest/SensorsTest.pde), then check for the streaming variables to make that the data you are receiving from the Arduino is correct. Depending on your setup, you may need to change the serial port is being called by changing the variable called on **line 22**, in this case it is port **1**.  To help you find your appropriate port, all of your serial ports are printed on launch.\r\n\r\n![processingtest](https://raw.github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/gh-pages/images/procesingtest.jpg)\r\n\r\n+ Next, open [Sensors2gDocs.pde](https://github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/blob/gh-pages/*Processing/Sensors2gDocs/Sensors2gDocs.pde) and, in the setup of your sketch, replace the **XXXXXXXXXX** in **lines 8 - 11**, with the information you recorded earlier from your google form. Now run the script and open your google form.\r\n \r\n###4. Visualize it\r\n+ If all is working correctly you should be seeing the information being updated. Next stop the Arduino so we can work on this spreadsheet without it conflicting. On the side of your spreadsheet, use the following formulas to find the last entry in each column and label these accordingly.   \r\n\r\n> =INDEX( A:A ; ROWS( A:A ) )  \r\n> =INDEX( B:B ; ROWS( B:B ) )  \r\n> =INDEX( C:C ; ROWS( C:C ) )   \r\n> =INDEX( D:D ; ROWS( D:D ) )     \r\n\r\n![spreadsheetformula](https://raw.github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/gh-pages/images/spreadsheetformula.jpg)   \r\n\r\n+ With the variables for Humidity, Temperature and Moisture selected **Insert** a **Gauge Chart**.   \r\n\r\n![gauge](https://raw.github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/gh-pages/images/gauge.jpg)   \r\n\r\n+ After you have a gauge chart created, toggle the menu option in the upper right and select to **Publish Chart** this will then give you the code needed to embed your gauges in another webpage.   \r\n\r\n![publishgauge](https://raw.github.com/mganucheau/Connect-to-the-Natural-World/gh-pages/images/publishgauge.jpg)   \r\n\r\nNote: The downside to viewing the gauge in this method is that the gauge chart will only update when the page is reloaded. To have the gauge automatically refresh we will need to call use some javascript to construct how we populate the gauge.  Stay tuned for that tutorial to come.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
